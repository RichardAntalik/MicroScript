# MicroScript
Javascript compiler for Microchip devices written in Javascript

Work is in progress.

Right now major part of JS syntax is understood by parser.
A brief todo for next few days(months heh):
  - Optimize parser code.
  - Parser support for more keywords
  - start writing "JS engine" and code simulator
  - API for very simple PIC device 
  - compiler and hello world in asm
